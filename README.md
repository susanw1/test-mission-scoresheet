Calculation sheet for SpaceX Test Mission
===

I did this scoresheet because I noticed the world became very confused about whether earlier tests, like SN10, were “Successful” or a “Failure”. I thought this would help people to put their own guesses and observations in and come out with a reasonable indicative success level as an easy to understand number, “Starship test was 74% successful”, sort of idea. 

Instructions:
---
Put your name at the top, and edit the numbers in the white boxes. The other ones do the calculations. The little blue number shows how successful you think the mission will be based on the numbers.

Then, during the test mission, put Y or N into the “Did Step Survive” column. The orange number shows the how successful the test is so far. If something blows up, then stop filling it in. Notice that after stage separation, we follow SuperHeavy and Starship separately.

When you're finished, publish your results!

Btw, we’re not going to worry too much about partial failures: most of the emphasis here is: “did it survive, or did it blow up?” (I did try allowing for partial failure, and entering the actual success as a %, but it was confusing and didn’t make much difference to the results. The biggest impact to the successful testing of later steps is catastrophic failure of an earlier step! Plus, you can get into knots over “we successfully showed that it fails!” questions).

Columns:	
---
* The “How Big Is This Step” column lets you say how relatively important this step is to the purpose of the Test Mission. Note that if you’re mostly testing launch, landing is low importance even if it means you blow up on landing. Only SpaceX really know these numbers, but we can estimate them from announcements. 
	
* The “Chance of Surviving…” column is a single percentage figure which is your guess as to whether the mission gets through this step:	
	0% means “no chance of surviving this step”, 100% means you don’t believe it can fail.

  Together, those values let us calculate the blue number, which indicates how much of the mission succeeded. 

* Finally, there’s the “Did Step Survive?” Actual Result column which must contain Y or N, and you fill it in as the test proceeds. The Orange figure totals up how much mission success has accumulated. That’s the figure that should be published!

The “Total Cumulative chance %” column is interesting – it shows how likely we are to finish a step, given that catastrophic failure of an earlier one means it might not be reached. I’ve underlined the final chances for SuperHeavy and Starship. I’ve also crossed out some final steps that have been revealed to be not attempted in this test.
